Data Warehouse Project
Overview
This project aims to build a modern Data Warehouse (DWH) that consolidates sales data, enabling advanced analytical reporting for informed decision-making. The data warehouse will be built using SQL Server, integrating sales data from two distinct sources: ERP and CRM systems.
Objectives
•	Data Engineering: Design and implement a data warehouse to integrate data from ERP and CRM sources, focusing on data cleansing and optimization for analytical purposes.
•	Data Analytics & Reporting: Create SQL-based analytics for actionable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
Project Specifications
Data Integration
•	Sources: Import CSV files from two separate systems: ERP and CRM.
•	Data Quality: Cleanse data to ensure accuracy and remove inconsistencies.
•	Integration: Combine data from both systems into a cohesive, user-friendly data model that supports analytical queries.
•	Scope: Focus on the most recent dataset, without the need for data historization.
Analytics & Reporting
•	Insights: Develop SQL queries to deliver insights into:
o	Customer Behavior
o	Product Performance
o	Sales Trends
•	These insights will empower business stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
Documentation
•	Provide comprehensive documentation of the data model for stakeholders and analytics teams to ensure understanding and usability.
