/*This script is designed to create a new database called DataWarehouse. It first checks if the database already existsâ€”if so, it drops and recreates it. The script also sets up three essential schemas within the newly created database:

bronze, silver ,gold

Important Warning:
Running this script will permanently delete the DataWarehouse database if it already exists. All data in the existing database will be erased. Ensure proper backups are taken before execution, as the operation cannot be undone.
